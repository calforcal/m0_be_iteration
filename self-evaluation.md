# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - I feel pretty good about the `each` method! Once you understand how the syntax is working its not so bad.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - Definitely was a little more difficult than anything else we've done. It required figuring out concepts outside of the scope of the lesson, like working with a basic conditional that definitely added a layer of complexity. Definitely a productive struggle trying to forget some syntax of other languages and making sure the code I wrote works.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I think I'm ok on the iterations / `each` method. Might need to practice conditionals syntax when we get there.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - No questions right now :) !
